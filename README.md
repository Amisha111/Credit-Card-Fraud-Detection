This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Financial fraud is a significant challenge, and this repository demonstrates a predictive modeling approach to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent with high precision.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 10,000 customer transactions to identify patterns and anomalies.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of a **Random Forest Classifier** to handle imbalanced financial data.
* **Performance Metrics:** Achieved a precision of **73%**, focusing on minimizing false positives to ensure high reliability in risk assessment.
* **Business Impact:** Provides insights for financial risk monitoring and regulatory alignment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Methodology
1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing transaction distributions and correlation matrices.
3.  **Model Building:** Training a Random Forest model.
4.  **Evaluation:** Using Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall curves, and Accuracy scores to validate results.

## 📈 Results
The model successfully identifies fraudulent patterns, aiding in automated risk detection and improving the accuracy of financial risk insights.
